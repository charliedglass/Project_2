# Project_2
Are you tired of sending letters in the mail or waiting for an email to get responded so you can communicate?. It takes too much time.
What if we can change that and decrease the waiting time? Well today is your lucky day because we have a better solution for you.

Welcome to our new and revolutionary Chat Application, which allows you to send messages instanly with all friends and family members that sign in.
The process is so simple, sign in if you have not and start adding new members to you list. And if you are already a member it will send you directly to the log in.

Technologies and langugues used in this project:

* Firebase
* Express
* Express-handlebars
* Mysql2
* Sequelize
* Bootstrap
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Node-Notifier

<b>NOTE</b>: if you are testing the app yourself, make sure each user is signed in on a separate browser. The app is currently dependent on session storage, so it will not work otherwise.
